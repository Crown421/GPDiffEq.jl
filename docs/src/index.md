# GPDiffEq.jl

The **GPDiffEq.jl** package facilitates learning the (nonlinear) vector field of unknown system using Gaussian Processes (GPs). 

It bridges the Universal Differential Equations in the [SciML](link) community using Neural Networks and GP ecosystem by the JuliaGaussianProcesses organization.
<!-- Eventually it aims to connect more broadly ... -->
