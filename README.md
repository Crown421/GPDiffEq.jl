# GPDiffEq

This package is intended to connect Gaussian Processes and differential equations in a similar fashion to [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl). 

There is currently work going on for some underlying packages. Once that is finished, this package should come together very quickly.
