This package is intended to connect Gaussian Processes and differential equations in a similar fashion to [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl). 

The motto of this package is currently "End-to-end, ready to be fixed". The basic functionality exists and now needs to be made robust and extended.
